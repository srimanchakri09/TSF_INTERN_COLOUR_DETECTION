HELLO, this is a python and openCV project which identifies different colours in images and as well as real time video or else any other recorded video is also possible.(865 colours)

As, the colour is a 3 dimensional array(R,G,B) and each value can take a max. value of 255. This is the fundamental concept that I'll be working with.

I have included the csv file of the color names and codes along with the sample image.
