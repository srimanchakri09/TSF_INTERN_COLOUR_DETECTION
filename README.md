HELLO friends, this is a computer vision based project made using python language which identifies different colours in images and as well as real time video or else any other recorded video is also possible.

we know that the colour is idenfied by using 3 values (R,G,B) this is the principle we are using for identifying the colour

I have included the csv file of the color names and codes along with the sample image.


PS : Here you can use the image which I have uploaded or else you can use your own image and change the image address in your code
